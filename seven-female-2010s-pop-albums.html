	<h1>
		7 Woman-led Pop/Rock Albums of the Late 2010’s (As ranked by my Spotify)
	</h1>

	<div class="section-item">

		<h2>
			After Laughter
		</h2>

			<h3>
				Paramore, led by Hayley Williams
			</h3>

			</div>

				<p>
					This album was released in 2017 following a four year hiatus from the band. It featured much more alt-pop songs than the band's previous punk-rock infamy.
				</p>

		<h2>
			Froot
		</h2>

			<h3>
				Marina and the Diamonds,  led by Marina Diamandis
			</h3>

			</div>

				<p>
					This album was a time of self-reflectance for Marina after the success of "Electra Heart". She has stated the entire album is about being happy, incorporating synth-pop and funk. Compared to her previous records, her voice has much more of a solo here, and is often compared to Kate Bush because of her elastic quality.

		<h2>
			Gaslighter
		</h2>

			<h3>
				The Chicks, with members Natalie Maines, Martie Maguire and Emily Straye
			</h3>

				<div class="album-cover-credit">


					<div class="album-cover">

					<img src="img/gaslighter.jpeg" alt="The Chicks (formerly the Dixie Chicks) Gaslighter album cover">

					<a class="photo-credit" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hZuOBl-nL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg">Courtesy of Amazon</a>

				</div>

					<p>
						Removing the 'dixie' from their name due to the implications and historical associations with such names, The Chicks' rebrand and Gaslighter debut offers something new. The lyrics surround issues of infidelity after Maines' divorce in 2019, which is the main inspiration of the album. Following a 14-year hiatus, this strong return was met with acclaim. This album was also co-produced with Jack Antonoff, who will return later in this list.

		<h2>
			My Love is Cool
		</h2>

			<h3>
				Wolf Alice, led by Ellen Rowsell
			</h3>

			<div class="album-cover-credit">

				<div class="album-cover">

				<img src="img/my-love-is-cool.jpeg" alt="Wolf Alice's My Love is Cool album cover">

				<a class="photo-credit" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31RDgrtBg8L._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg">Courtesy of Amazon</a>

			</div>

				<p>
					A very definitively grunge '90s or early oughts-sounding album, My Love is cool brings a newness to the genre that breaks from the mold with a band who sounds their own. The songs capture their own sensations, going from alt-rock to metal grunge.
				</p>

		<h2>
			Melodrama
		</h2>
			
			<h3>
				Lorde, known as Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor
			</h3>


			<div class="album-cover-credit">

				<div class="album-cover">

				<img src="img/melodrama.jpeg" alt="Lorde's Melodrama album cover">

				<a class="photo-credit" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516iUNWINpL._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg">Courtesy of Amazon</a>

			</div>

				<p>
					Bringing a completely different vibe than her debut, Melodrama introduces a more grown-up person, going through heartbreak and regret, highs and lows as she makes her way through life and deals with the fame. One recurring theme is love and heartbreak, which in her real life came from a breakup and love interest and co-producer, Jack Antonoff.

		<h2>
			Dirty Computer
		</h2>

			<h3>
				Janelle Monáe
			</h3>

			<div class="album-cover-credit">

				<a class="photo-credit" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gjiyln16L._UX500_FMwebp_QL85_.jpg">Courtesy of Amazon</a>

			</div>


				<p>
					Breaking into the larger pop scene than just a 'radom minor note you hear in major songs', Monáe discusses Blackness, sexuality and more broadly identity. Current events are woven into a pop-funk beat with vocals showing her huge range in tone and pitch.
				</p>

			Heard it in a Past Life
		</h2>

			<h3>
				Maggie Rogers
			</h3>

			</div>

				<p>
					When your praise from Pharrell Williams is "I have zero notes", you as an artist know something big is coming. And that was the case for Rogers. Her debut album, which is mostly folk-pop features amazing vocals and a relaxed vibe which makes for a floaty listening experience. It's a sound I can only call natural and etheral.
